
### Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
It's designed for building scalable, networked applications.
Uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

### Key Features of Node.js

Single-threaded, non-blocking architecture.
Built-in asynchronous I/O libraries.
A vast ecosystem of third-party packages (npm).
Easily handles real-time, data-intensive applications.

### Setting Up Node.js

To get started with Node.js, download and install it from the official website.
Node Package Manager (npm) comes bundled with Node.js for package management.
Verify your installation with node -v and npm -v commands.

### Creating a Simple Node.js Application

Create a JavaScript file (e.g., app.js) with your Node.js code.
Use require to include modules (e.g., const http = require('http');).
Start a simple HTTP server (e.g., http.createServer()).

### NPM and Package Management

Use npm to manage external packages and dependencies.
Initialize a Node.js project with npm init.
Install packages using npm install package-name.
Create a package.json file to specify project dependencies.

### Event Loop and Callbacks

Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking architecture.
Understand the event loop and how callbacks work.
Example of handling asynchronous operations using callbacks.
